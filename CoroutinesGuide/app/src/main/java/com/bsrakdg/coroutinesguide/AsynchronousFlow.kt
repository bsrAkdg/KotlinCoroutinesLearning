            that is running in the main thread (look at log)

            Notice the following differences in the code with the Flow from the earlier examples:
            - A builder function for Flow type is called flow.
            - Code inside the flow { ... } builder block can suspend.
            - The flowSample function is no longer marked with suspend modifier.
            - Values are emitted from the flow using emit function.
            - Values are collected from the flow using collect function.

            We can replace delay with Thread.sleep in the body of flowSample's flow { ... } and
            see that the main thread is blocked in this case.
