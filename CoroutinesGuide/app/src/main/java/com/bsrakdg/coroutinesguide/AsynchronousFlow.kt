            - The flowSample function is no longer marked with suspend modifier.
            - Values are emitted from the flow using emit function.
            - Values are collected from the flow using collect function.

            We can replace delay with Thread.sleep in the body of flowSample's flow { ... } and
            see that the main thread is blocked in this case.

        The important difference to sequences is that blocks of code inside these operators can call suspending functions.
