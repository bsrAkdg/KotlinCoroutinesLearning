fun structuredConcurrency() {
    /*
        There is still something to be desired for practical usage of coroutines.
        When we use GlobalScope.launch, we create a top-level coroutine.
        Even though it is light-weight, it still consumes some memory resources while it runs.
        If we forget to keep a reference to the newly launched coroutine, it still runs.
        What if the code in the coroutine hangs (for example, we erroneously delay for too long),
        what if we launched too many coroutines and ran out of memory? Having to manually keep
        references to all the launched coroutines and join them is error-prone.

        There is a better solution. We can use structured concurrency in our code.
        Instead of launching coroutines in the GlobalScope, just like we usually do with threads
        (threads are always global), we can launch coroutines in the specific scope of
        the operation we are performing.

        In our example, we have a main function that is turned into a coroutine using the
        runBlocking coroutine builder. Every coroutine builder, including runBlocking, adds
        an instance of CoroutineScope to the scope of its code block. We can launch coroutines in
        this scope without having to join them explicitly, because an outer coroutine
        (runBlocking in our example) does not complete until all the coroutines launched in its
        scope complete. Thus, we can make our example simpler:

        your own scope using the coroutineScope builder. It creates a coroutine scope and does not
        complete until all launched children complete.

        runBlocking and coroutineScope may look similar because they both wait for their body and
        all its children to complete. The main difference is that the runBlocking method blocks
        the current thread for waiting, while coroutineScope just suspends, releasing the underlying
        thread for other usages. Because of that difference, runBlocking is a regular function and
        coroutineScope is a suspending function.

        used inside coroutines just like regular functions, but their additional feature is that
        they can, in turn, use other suspending functions (like delay in this example) to suspend
        execution of a coroutine.

        But what if the extracted function contains a coroutine builder which is invoked on

        Making doWorld an extension method on CoroutineScope is one of the solutions, but it may
        not always be applicable as it does not make the API clearer. The idiomatic solution is to
        have either an explicit CoroutineScope as a field in a class containing the target function
        or an implicit one when the outer class implements CoroutineScope. As a last resort,
        CoroutineScope(coroutineContext) can be used, but such an approach is structurally unsafe
        because you no longer have control on the scope of execution of this method.
        Only private APIs can use this builder.
